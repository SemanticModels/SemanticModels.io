# What is a Semantic Model?
A semantic model is a model of concepts about a subject area, as understood by a community of stakeholders, defined in such a way that the meaning of those concepts can be precise, understood by the stakeholders and processed by computer software. 
Semantic models are structured information about the subject area, as opposed to unstructured information, such as natural language. The concepts, terms and structure used to define a semantic model is a language for Semantic Modeling. Expressing a model in a Semantic Modeling language helps to define the meaning of the concepts in that model, the model semantics. Each concept in a model becomes the definition of a term in the domains vocabulary, linking how stakeholders speak about their domain and how it may be expressed in a systems.
While a Semantic Modeling language provides a foundation for defining the semantics of concepts, it is not enough. The language must be used with care and precision to capture, disambiguate and precisely define the concepts.
 
There are multiple terms that, more or less, capture some of the intent of semantic models. Some of these terms include:
•	Semantic model
•	Ontology
•	Conceptual Domain Model
•	Computation Independent Model (CIM)
•	Conceptual Information Model
•	Concept Model
•	Structured Taxonomy
